I am the founder of SDN Essentials and have been involved with open contrail from the start, actually doing some of the initial deployments myself when contrail was first released and not very stable ðŸ˜Š I was also doing the basic training classes and workshops for Contrail.  We then started to grow our team, and I moved the hands-on portion to the PS team where we worked with a handful on clients (ATT being the largest).  I was also involved in a product that integrated with Contrail, a network orchestrator called NFV Grid.  In May of this year, SDN Essentials was sold to a new parent company (Redapt.com) so the software did not stay with SDN Essentials.  From an open source and standards bodies perspective, I was the WAN Carrier Chair for the ONF for two years and also help build their SDN certification exam. (I wrote a lot of the OSCA).  Most recently, been more involved in the MEF and their initiatives.   SDN Essentials is also a silver member of Open Daylight and a member of the New Ip Agency (lightreading).    We have about 10 contrail engineers on staff, and have a lap with 24 instances of contrail/openstack for our training classes.
