# Welcome to the Tungsten Fabric Community
Tungsten Fabric is the new name of the Open Source project formerly known as
OpenContrail. We have reorganized the governance structure and welcome new
contributors. The following public meetings are held weekly via Zoom conference
call and all participants are welcome.

it will be subsumed into the Technical Steering Committee when Tungsten Fabric
joins the Linux Foundation Networking series of projects.
